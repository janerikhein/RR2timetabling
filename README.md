This repository contains the source code for the implementation of my Bachelor's thesis "Combining a decomposition scheme with Metaheuristics for round-robin tournament scheduling".

The problem considered was based on the problem statement of the 21. International Timetabling Competition (ITC2021) and was implemented in Julia using the Gurobi MIP solver.
